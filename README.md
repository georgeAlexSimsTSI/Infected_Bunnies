Main branch is the first version written to initial specification
Grid branch has extension tasks implemented

# Infected Bunnies

This version of the project has the Extension task 3 implemented.

<pre>
★★★

Modify the program to place the rabbits in an 80x80 grid. Have the rabbits move one space each turn randomly.

Mark juvenile males with m, adult males w/ M,

Juvenile females w/ f, adult females w/ F

Infected bunnies with X

Modify the program so that infected bunnies only convert bunnies that end of a turn on an adjacent square.

Modify the program so that new babies are born in an empty random adjacent square next to the mother bunny. (if no empty square exits then the baby bunny isn't born)
</pre>

# Notes before running

* In the main method where the object manager is constructed the variables gridHeight and gridWidth can be used to change the dimensions of the grid.

* The startingNumber changes the starting amount. I would recommend going larger as these rabbits are placed in random positions.

* The Verbose variable determines how much information the program outputs. When using the grid version I would recommend having it set to false.
